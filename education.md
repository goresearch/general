# Education
## Foreword
How much storage will a 1 million words English history book use? 5MB. How many books does a person read lifetime on average? Let's say 1000. That's 5GB in total, smaller than capacity of the smallest flash drive you usually find in the market.

That says we did something right. But our education status worldwide is not optimistic. More work needs to be done.

## Standalone AI
### Features
- AI can be offline, with the capability to grow offline or online
- affordable resource usage (space, computing power)
- could be very knowledgeable and good at communication/teaching

Makes it a good choice for:
- private teacher
- offline library
- personalized resources and teaching

### Need to consider
- quality control
- authenticity (for example certification similar to the human teacher profession)
- views/beliefs/values
- personality
- knowledge/resources backend

### Why standalone
- online could be expensive or even impossible in some places some times:
  - Cuba's 'offline internet': https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/23/cuba-offline-internet-weekly-packet-external-hard-drives
  - In China, the ‘Great Firewall’ Is Changing a Generation: https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/09/01/china-great-firewall-changing-generation
  - 2019 Internet blackout in Iran: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Internet_blackout_in_Iran
- hybrid could be a balanced design

### Todo
- [ ] how many resources are needed: storage space, computing power, updates/growth/personalization
- [ ] what technical ability could we expect in the near feature
- [ ] designing
- [ ] planning and prepare
