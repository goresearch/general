# Consumption
## Guidelines
- local: prefer local instead from other areas or foreign
- seasonal: more fresh and in sync with nature
- direct: shorten supply chain, for example from farmer directly instead of supermarket
- fresh: it's one key aspect in terms of good quality
- ripeness: prefer naturally ripe ones
